# User Authentication With Express and Mongo

## Description
Bookworm is a fictional site that I built to demonstrate my knowledge of user authentication.

## The Stack
The technologies I used for this project are Pug for templating, CSS for styling, Express.js for handling user authentication, and Mongoose for interfacing with the data storage layer (MongoDB).

## Getting Started
To view this project on your local machine, you must have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installed. Once you've installed Node, clone this repo, and then run `npm start` in your terminal (in the same location of the clone). The project should now be ready to view at `http://localhost:3000`!
